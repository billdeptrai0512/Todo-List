# Todo-List
JavaScript Course


I made this project to provide myself a tool to track my daily task

I believe everyone will have at least 1-3 task need to finish that day, they will also suddenly come up with many idea and want to save it 

This tool will allow user to create Task/Idea and store it to LocalStorage

There are 4 task :
- Today: User can add Task/Idea | Edit or Delete | Change Status (Done/Important) of the Task/Idea
- All Task: Show all task that haven't finished
- All Idea: Show all idea that haven't finished
- Important: Show all task/idea that haven't finished but Important
The schedule allow user to check Task/Date of any Date in the past
